# textit

An ill-fated text editor I wrote mostly in the summer break of 2021. It's got some things going for it, but is probably not a very useful reference for how to program anything well.
Feel free to take the code and do whatever you want with it!

Run build.bat from the x64 Native Command Tools Prompt that ships with the Visual Studio build tools to compile (or otherwise include the required MSVC environment variables).
